abstract = {Scenario-based testing for the safety validation of highly automated vehicles is a promising approach that is being examined in research and industry. This approach heavily relies on data from real-world scenarios to derive the necessary scenario information for testing. Measurement data should be collected at a reasonable effort, contain naturalistic behavior of road users and include all data relevant for a description of the identified scenarios in sufficient quality. However, the current measurement methods fail to meet at least one of the requirements. Thus, we propose a novel method to measure data from an aerial perspective for scenario-based validation fulfilling the mentioned requirements. Furthermore, we provide a large-scale naturalistic vehicle trajectory dataset from German highways called highD. We evaluate the data in terms of quantity, variety and contained scenarios. Our dataset consists of 16.5 hours of measurements from six locations with 110 000 vehicles, a total driven distance of 45 000 km and 5600 recorded complete lane changes.},

abstract = {The new era of sharing information and “big data” has raised our expectations to make mobility more predictable and controllable through a better utilization of data and existing resources. The realization of these opportunities requires going beyond the existing traditional ways of collecting traffic data that are based either on fixed-location sensors or GPS devices with low spatial coverage or penetration rates and significant measurement errors, especially in congested urban areas. Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) or simply “drones” have been proposed as a pioneering tool of the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) infrastructure due to their unique characteristics, but various challenges have kept these efforts only at a small size. This paper describes the system architecture and preliminary results of a first-of-its-kind experiment, nicknamed pNEUMA, to create the most complete urban dataset to study congestion. A swarm of 10 drones hovering over the central business district of Athens over multiple days to record traffic streams in a congested area of a 1.3 km2 area with more than 100 km-lanes of road network, around 100 busy intersections (signalized or not), many bus stops and close to half a million trajectories. The aim of the experiment is to record traffic streams in a multi-modal congested environment over an urban setting using UAS that can allow the deep investigation of critical traffic phenomena. The pNEUMA experiment develops a prototype system that offers immense opportunities for researchers many of which are beyond the interests and expertise of the authors. This open science initiative creates a unique observatory of traffic congestion, a scale an-order-of-magnitude higher than what was available till now, that researchers from different disciplines around the globe can use to develop and test their own models.},

@article{Schwarting2019,
abstract = {Deployment of autonomous vehicles on public roads promises increased efficiency and safety. It requires understanding the intent of human drivers and adapting to their driving styles. Autonomous vehicles must also behave in safe and predictable ways without requiring explicit communication. We integrate tools from social psychology into autonomous-vehicle decision making to quantify and predict the social behavior of other drivers and to behave in a socially compliant way. A key component is Social Value Orientation (SVO), which quantifies the degree of an agent's selfishness or altruism, allowing us to better predict how the agent will interact and cooperate with others. We model interactions between agents as a best-response game wherein each agent negotiates to maximize their own utility. We solve the dynamic game by finding the Nash equilibrium, yielding an online method of predicting multiagent interactions given their SVOs. This approach allows autonomous vehicles to observe human drivers, estimate their SVOs, and generate an autonomous control policy in real time. We demonstrate the capabilities and performance of our algorithm in challenging traffic scenarios: merging lanes and unprotected left turns. We validate our results in simulation and on human driving data from the NGSIM dataset. Our results illustrate how the algorithm's behavior adapts to social preferences of other drivers. By incorporating SVO, we improve autonomous performance and reduce errors in human trajectory predictions by 25%.},

@article{Talebpour2015a,
abstract = {Vehicle-to-Vehicle communications provide the opportunity to create an internet of cars through the recent advances in communication technologies, processing power, and sensing technologies. A connected vehicle receives real-time information from surrounding vehicles; such information can improve drivers' awareness about their surrounding traffic condition and lead to safer and more efficient driving maneuvers. Lane-changing behavior, as one of the most challenging driving maneuvers to understand and to predict, and a major source of congestion and collisions, can benefit from this additional information. This paper presents a lane-changing model based on a game-theoretical approach that endogenously accounts for the flow of information in a connected vehicular environment. A calibration approach based on the method of simulated moments is presented and a simplified version of the proposed framework is calibrated against NGSIM data. The prediction capability of the simplified model is validated. It is concluded the presented framework is capable of predicting lane-changing behavior with limitations that still need to be addressed. Finally, a simulation framework based on the fictitious play is proposed. The simulation results revealed that the presented lane-changing model provides a greater level of realism than a basic gap-acceptance model.},

@article{Treiber2008,
abstract = {The fuel consumption of vehicular traffic (and associated CO2 emissions) on a given road section depends strongly on the velocity profiles of the vehicles. The basis for a detailed estimation is therefore the consumption rate as a function of instantaneous velocity and acceleration. This paper will present a model for the instantaneous fuel consumption that includes vehicle properties, engine properties, and gear-selection schemes and implement it for different passenger car types representing the vehicle fleet under consideration. The paper will apply the model to trajectories from microscopic traffic simulation. The proposed model can directly be used in a microscopic traffic simulation software to calculate fuel consumption and derived emission such as carbon dioxide. Next to travel times, the fuel consumption is an important measure for the performance of future Intelligent Transportation Systems. Furthermore, the model is applied to real traffic situations by taking the velocity and acceleration as input from several sets of the NGSIM trajectory data. Dedicated data processing and smoothing algorithms have been applied to the NGSIM data to suppress the data noise that is multiplied by the necessary differentiations for obtaining more realistic velocity and acceleration time series. On the road sections covered by the NGSIM data, we found that traffic congestion typically lead to an increase of fuel consumption of the order of 80% while the traveling time has increased by a factor of up to 4. We conclude that the influence of congestion on fuel consumption is distinctly lower than that on travel time.},
